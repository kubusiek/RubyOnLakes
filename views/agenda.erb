               <h1>Skippers</h1>
               <p>If you have papers and want to be a skipper please let me know</p>

               <h1>People</h1>
               Feel free to invite other devs or just your friends ;]

               <h1>Sailing</h1>
               <p>Those are ships we will take:<a href='http://northman.pl/en/jachty/maxus-28-3/#gallery'> Gallery</a></p>

              <h1>Route</h1>
              <p>Sztynort -> Węgorzewo -> Sztynort</p>

              <h1>Date</h1>
              <p>29.08.2015- 31.08.2015</p>

              <h1>Cost</h1>
              <p>Cost is 1762zł per boat. Those boats are designed for 10 people, but if realy focus on comfort and stuff because f.e. you want to take your wife & children then you should go with max 8 ppl per boat. At Sztynort and Węgorzewo we will rent a place there we can have presentations. That is 100zł/hour so i assume we should get 500zł-600zł for that . Another cost are port-payments that is about 100zł per boat for whole cruise. And last cost is deposit that we should get back after cruise if we won't destroy our boats ;D (about 1000zł per boat). If we won't collect enough ruby-skippers than we have to hire some , then cost will be a little bit higher. So for person whole cost should be about 250-350zł - depends on how many people go to 1 boat. + deposit</p>

              <h1>CoC</h1>
              <p>Salining ethics rules - also that is not official event but holidays with friends from community ;]</p>
